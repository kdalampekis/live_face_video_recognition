# üíä Smart Video Recognition System: Pill Intake & Face Recognition with TensorFlow

This project combines **video-based action recognition**, **face detection and recognition**, and **real-time inference** using TensorFlow and OpenCV.  
It includes training pipelines, live detection scripts, face embedding generators, and conversion tools to TensorFlow Lite.
